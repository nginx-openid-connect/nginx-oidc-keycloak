- [Create a new User Pool](#create-a-new-user-pool)
- [Create a user](#create-a-user)
- [Create a domain](#create-a-domain)
- [Create or Edit a new Application](#create-or-edit-a-new-application)

## Create a new User Pool

1. Log in to your AWS account, open the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com), and navigate to the Cognito dashboard (you can, for example, click **`Cognito`** in the **Security, Identity, & Compliance** section of the **Services** drop‑down menu).

2. On the Cognito dashboard, click **Manage User Pools** to open the **Your User Pools** window. Click the **`Create a user pool`**  button or the highlighted phrase.

4. Configure **security requirements** as the following example:

   > Note: Select `No MFA` for your quick testing. Otherwise configure multi-factor authentication.

   ![](./img/cognito-app-client-host-UI-settings.png)

   - 4.1 In the sections of **Allowed callback URLs** and **Allowed sign-out URLs**, type the URI of the NGINX Plus instance including the port number, and ending in **`/_codexch`** for callback URL and **`/_logout`** for sign-out URL as follows.

     - **Allowed callback URLs**: `https://nginx.cognito.test:443/_codexch`.
     - **Allowed sign-out URLs**: `https://nginx.cognito.test:443/_logout`.

     > **Notes:**
     >
     > - For production, we strongly recommend that you use SSL/TLS (port 443).
     > - The port number is mandatory even when you’re using the default port for HTTP (80) or HTTPS (443). But it it isn't needed if you use NGINX ACM.
